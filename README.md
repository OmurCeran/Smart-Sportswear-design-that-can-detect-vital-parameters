# Smart Sportswear design that can detect vital parameters
Athletes can now provide a variety of real-time data during training sessions and
competitions thanks to the development of sophisticated sensors and equipment.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and activity patterns are among the factors included
in these data. We can learn more about the variability in heart rate in athletes and keep
an eye on their cardiac health while exercising by collecting ECG data. We may also
evaluate the body movements of athletes by examining their acceleration, which gives
us important details about their technique, balance, and coordination. Sensors provide
information about cardiac activity, accelerometers measure patterns of movement, and
ECG sensors monitor cardiac activity.
